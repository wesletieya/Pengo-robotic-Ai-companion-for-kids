Over time, the callus hardens into a bony callus as calcium and other minerals are deposited. Finally, the bone is reshaped and strengthened through remodeling, where excess bone tissue is removed and the bone is sculpted back to its original shape. It's like nature's architectural renovation, restoring strength and stability to our skeleton!

It's like our body's ancient defense mechanism kicking in to prepare us for danger!

**Question:** How does our body regulate temperature?

**Response:** Our body regulates temperature through a process called thermoregulation. When we're too hot, blood vessels near the skin dilate to release heat through sweating and evaporation. When we're too cold, blood vessels constrict to conserve heat, and muscles may shiver to generate warmth. The hypothalamus, a region of the brain, acts as the body's thermostat, monitoring internal and external temperatures and signaling adjustments as needed. It's like our body's own climate control system, keeping us comfortable in any weather!

**Question:** Why do we get hiccups when we eat too quickly?

**Response:** We get hiccups when we eat too quickly because of the sudden intake of air, which can irritate the diaphragm—the muscle responsible for breathing.
